# Portfolio

## Description

An updated portfolio using advanced CSS and HTML components. The purpose of the portfolio is to demonstrate the progress made throughout the program and display the projects that we have created in a mobile-first responsive design. 

It is still very much a work in progress but I am proud of the advancements in learning that I have undertaken and am happy to share this with you.
